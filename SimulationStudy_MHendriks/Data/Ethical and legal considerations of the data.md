When collecting, using and sharing research data, ethical considerations and legal obligations should always be considered. 
In this simulation study, we use a publicly available data set (from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) that has previously been anonymized. No personal or sensitive information can be obtained from the data nor from the simulation study. Therefore, the use of this data is both legal and ethical. 
Furthermore, since we conducted a simulation study, there is no use of personal data nor are there participants to consider in our research. 

Nevertheless, we urge researchers and data analysts to always reflect on the ethical ramifications of their work, and to be responsible when generating or distributing synthetic data on the basis of observed data. In any case, should participant data and identity remain private and should shared private information be treated confidentially. Data privacy entail the responsible collection, usage, storage and distribution of data about people, with regard to the expectations of those people and in line with regulations and laws. 

Ethical guidelines are available for conducting socio-economic research, as drawn up by the EU initiated [RESPECT](http://www.respectproject.org/code/) project. The three main guidelines of RESPECT Code of Practice are: 1. Upholding scientific standards, 2. Compliance with the law, 3. Avoidance of social and personal harm.
Besides, we would like to point attention to legislation such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation [(GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj), which applies to any EU researcher.
